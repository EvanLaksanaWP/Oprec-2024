# README

Please note that the extension built from this repository is not compatible with JupyterLab and should be used with the classic notebook (i.e., notebook version 6 or lower).

To install the compatible version of the notebook, run the following command:

```bash
pip install notebook==6.1.5
```

For JupyterLab and Notebook version 7 users, it is recommended to use the RISE JupyterLab extension instead. You can install it using the following command:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab-rise
```

To customize RISE, navigate to the "Nbextension" menu.
